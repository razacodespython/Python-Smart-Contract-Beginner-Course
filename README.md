## Introduction
Welcome to the Python Smart Contract Beginner Course! This repository is designed as a comprehensive guide for anyone interested in diving into the world of smart contracts using Python. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some experience in programming, this course is structured to provide you with a solid foundation in smart contract development and the tools necessary to navigate and innovate in this exciting field.

## Libraries Used
In this course, we will primarily be using the following Python libraries:

Vyper: Vyper is a contract-oriented, pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is designed to be simple and to offer greater security, particularly for those new to blockchain development.

Ape: Ape is a Python framework for blockchain development. It offers tools and plugins for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts, making the development process more efficient and less error-prone.

Web3.py: Web3.py is a Python library for interacting with Ethereum. It is the Python equivalent of Web3.js, providing a wide array of functionalities to connect with Ethereum nodes, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, and more.

## Course Structure
In this course each lesson will focus developing smart contracts using Vyper, Ape and web3.py. Step by step we're going to build the skills to become a full fledged blockchain developer using Python.
